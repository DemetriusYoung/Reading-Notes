  英国威斯敏斯特教堂墓志铭  An epitaph taken from Westminster — anonymous
  
  When I was young and free and my imagination had no limits I dreamed of changing the world.  
  
  As I grew older and wiser, I discovered the world would not change. 
  
  So I shortened my sights somewhat and decided to change only my country. 
  
  But it too seemed immovable.  
  
  As I grew into my twilight years, 
  
  in one last desperate attempt I settled for changing only family, 
  
  those closest to me But alas, they would have none of it.  
  
  And now as I lay on my deathbed, I suddenly realise : 
  
  If I had only changed myself first  Then, 
  
  by example I would have changed my family. 
  
  From their inspiration and encouragement, I would then have been able to better my country And who knows, 
  
  I may even have changed the world
