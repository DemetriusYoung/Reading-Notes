英国威斯敏斯特教堂墓志铭 

An epitaph taken from Westminster — anonymous


When I was young and free and my imagination had no limits 

I dreamed of changing the world. 

As I grew older and wiser, I discovered the world would not change. 

So I shortened my sights somewhat and decided to change only my country.

But it too seemed immovable.  

As I grew into my twilight years, in one last desperate attempt

I settled for changing only family, those closest to me 

But alas, they would have none of it. 

And now as I lay on my deathbed, I suddenly realise : 

If I had only changed myself first 

Then, by example I would have changed my family. 

From their inspiration and encouragement, 

I would then have been able to better my country 

And who knows, I may even have changed the world


在我年轻的时候  

我曾梦想改变这个世界

可当我成熟以后  

我发现我不能够改变这个世界  

于是 我将目光缩短一些  

那就只改变我的国家吧  

可当我到了暮年的时候  

我发现我根本没有能力改变我的国家  

于是 我最后的愿望仅仅是改变我的家庭

可是这也是不可能的  

当我躺在床上行将就木的时候  

我突然意识到：  

如果当初我仅仅是从改变自己开始  

也许我就能改变我的家庭  

在家人的帮助和鼓励下

也许我就能为我的国家做一些事情  

然后，谁知道呢？  

说不定我能改变这个世界！
